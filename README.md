Description
==============

A repository that contains the boundaries of all Australian suburbs as individual KML files.

Why?
====

For a long time I have looked for a free method of getting the borders of Australian suburbs, but have always been frustrated
 by having to pay for them.

One drunken evening I happened to stumble across the Australian Bureau of Statistic's (ABS) website, which offered the administrative
 boundaries of suburbs as a free to download shapefile. Armed with a copy of global mapper, I managed to export the shapefile to a
 KML file.

 With this KML file, a free copy of the Gazeteer of Australia and some custom java code, I have generated an individual KML
 file for each of the suburbs in Australia.

This data comes from the ABS, and I do not take any responsibility for any inaccuracies.
